Okay. This blog is of the geekz, by the geekz and for the geekz. The main purpose of this blog... varies, 'cause many other great authors will come along, but for now, just for my purpose, it will be:

- `Documentation`: there are so many interesting things found on the web when I was trying to find solutions for some tough problems, and my browser's bookmark bar has limited space. Ranging from HTML, CSS, JS, ReactJS, AngularJS, Cordova, Linux, Wordpress, Vim, etc, the topics are various and ever expanding!

- `Reviewing`: it would be interesting for the me in a year from now looking back and see how stupid I was in the past. It will be easier to compare and measure how much I have improved as time goes by, thus providing a more realistic timeline & goal for the next year. Having some frames of reference is always good!

- `Sharing`: the most important of it all! Sharing knowledge between us developers will benefits all!


My structure of each post will be:

- Each post will talk, discuss a specific topic of one of those above categories.

- Each post will be divide into 3 sections:

  * `The TL;DR section`: for quick reference, no bullshit involved

  * `The in-depth section`: explaining, studying the code in-depth

  * `The case study section`: some real case application of the topic, some rant may involved.

That's it for now. The real first post will be up tomorrow evening. Maybe some lighthearted topic about CSS would be ideal?
